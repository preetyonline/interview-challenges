Challenge #2
We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS or Azure or GCP
and provide a json formatted output.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Prerequisite for the above challenge:
Use pip to install the following,
1. pip install azure-identity
2. pip install azure-mgmt-compute
3. pip install az.cli
   
Challenge #3
We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and
get back the value.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
